# This script explains what it means to "run a script" in simple terms.

echo "What does it mean to 'run a script'?"

echo "
A script is a set of instructions written in a programming language that tells a computer what to do.
When we say 'run a script,' we mean that we are asking the computer to follow these instructions step by step.

Here's a simple example:
Imagine you have a recipe for making a cake. The recipe has a list of ingredients and step-by-step instructions.
Running a script is like following the recipe to make the cake.

In the world of computers, scripts can do many things, such as:
- Automating repetitive tasks (like cleaning up files or backing up data)
- Setting up software (like installing programs or configuring settings)
- Processing data (like analyzing text or numbers)

When you run a script, the computer reads the instructions and performs the tasks specified in the script.
It's a way to make the computer do things automatically, without needing to do each step manually.

For example, a script to greet you might look like this:
#!/bin/bash
echo 'Hello, World!'

When you run this script, the computer will display the message 'Hello, World!' on the screen.

In summary, running a script means telling the computer to execute a series of predefined instructions to accomplish a task.
